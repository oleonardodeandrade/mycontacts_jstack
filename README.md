# MyContacts API

This repository contains the MyContacts API, developed as part of the JStack Course. It is a powerful and efficient solution for managing contact information. With a comprehensive set of functions including create, read, update, and delete operations, the MyContacts API simplifies the management of contact records.

## Features

- **Create**: Easily create new contact records with relevant details such as name, email, phone number, and more.
- **Read**: Retrieve contact information using various search parameters, enabling quick and precise access to the desired records.
- **Update**: Seamlessly update existing contact records, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Delete**: Effortlessly remove unwanted contact records, maintaining data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The MyContacts API is developed using Node.js, a powerful and versatile runtime environment for server-side applications.
- **Express**: Built with Express, a fast and minimalistic web application framework for Node.js, the MyContacts API ensures efficient routing, middleware integration, and request handling.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the MyContacts API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mycontacts-api`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The MyContacts API exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /contacts`: Create a new contact.
- `GET /contacts`: Retrieve all contacts.
- `GET /contacts/:id`: Retrieve a specific contact by ID.
- `PUT /contacts/:id`: Update a specific contact by ID.
- `DELETE /contacts/:id`: Delete a specific contact by ID.

Please note that the MyContacts API currently uses mock data and does not connect to a database. The data is stored in memory during the runtime of the application.

## Mock Data

The MyContacts API uses the following mock data as an example:

```javascript
let contacts = [
  {
    id: v4(),
    name: 'Leonardo',
    email: 'leonardo@gmail.com',
    phone: '1212121',
    category_id: v4(),
  },
  {
    id: v4(),
    name: 'Jos√©',
    email: 'jose@gmail.com',
    phone: '1212121',
    category_id: v4(),
  },
];
```

Please note that the `v4()` function is a placeholder representing a unique identifier generator.

For detailed documentation on the API endpoints and their usage, please refer to the API documentation or the source code.
